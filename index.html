	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>
		We offer free clothing on a seasonal basis to <b>school-aged children</b> residing in Snohomish County.
		Size availability varies depending upon donations, but in general we stock sizes from 4T up to teen/adult XXL.
	</p>
	<p>
		A child may receive clothing from us every 4 months (maximum 3 times per year). At each visit, the child will receive
		a set of gently used, school-appropriate clothing, consisting of:
		<ul>
			<li>3 shirts</li>
			<li>2 sweatshirts</li>
			<li>1 coat</li>
			<li>2-3 pairs of sweatpants and/or leggings (girls only)</li>
			<li>3 pairs of underwear (new)</li>
			<li>3 pairs of socks (new)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		As a temporary health and safety measure during the current pandemic,
		<b>clothing selections will be made by our volunteers</b> using parent guidance provided on the appointment
		form. Parents will pick up pre-chosen clothing from our location <b>by appointment</b> only.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this time, since we are unable to allow client to try on items, <b>we are temporarily unable to provide shoes or
			jeans</b>. These items will return to availability when we are able to safely open our building to shoppers.
		</p>
		<p>
		To receive clothing for your child, please make an appointment using our online tool.
		As a part of the appointment process, you will be be asked questions about your child's age and clothing
		sizes and preferences.
		Get more information or begin your appointment process <a href="?appointments">here</a>.
