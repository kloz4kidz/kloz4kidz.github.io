<!-- main page content when Volunteering navigation is selected -->
<div id="content-volunteering" style="display:none;">
	<h2>Volunteering</h2>
	<p>We always need volunteers! 
		We are an entirely volunteer-run organization; if you are considering coming to work with us, 
		we are grateful.  Without you we would not be able to continue serving Snohomish County families.
	</p>  
	<h3>Current highest volunteer needs: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li class="odd">
			<strong>We are currently looking for a scheduling coordinator.</strong> 
			This would be a great job for someone who prefers to help from home, on their own schedule.
			This person will be responsible for confirming client appointments and maintaining the volunteer schedule. 
			We use online tools for some of the scheduling and tracking, so a level of comfort with technology
			would be a plus -- or a desire to learn!  
		</li>
		<li class="even"><strong>Our greatest ongoing need is for people to work directly with families.</strong> 
			These volunteers sign up for one or more 3 hour shifts per month, during which they help with clothing sizing and selection,
			and keep records of client visits.  Training is provided, and a background check (provided by K4K) is required.
			Note that many of our dedicated, ongoing volunteers are in a high-risk age group for Covid-19,
			and to protect their health, it is absolutely essential that we get more help in this area.
		</li>
		<li class="odd">
			As we prepare to reopen our portable for in-person shopping, 
			we need volunteers to <strong>sort donations and stock our shelves</strong>.
			These volunteers check clothing for stains or tears, fold or hang them, and keep an eye on our inventory levels.
			A regular commitment is preferred, but even a single session helps, 
			so this is a great way to pitch in if you don't have a lot of time to spare.
		</li>
		<li class="even">
			Because we launder all our clothing donations, 
			<strong>we always need people to wash and dry loads of clothes at home.</strong>
			This is a super simple, low-commitment way to help. Volunteers simply take a bag of clothes home,
			wash, dry, and fold it, and return it to us.
		</li>
		<li class="odd">
			Do you have idea about another way you could help?  We want to hear your ideas!  
			Let us know what you're thinking!
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you'd like more information about volunteering, have questions, or want to sign up, please email us 
		at <span class="email"><strong>questions@kloz4kidz.com</strong></span> or <span class="email"><strong>k4kvolunteering@gmail.com</strong></span>.
	</p>
	<h4>In the below 2018 video, hear some of our volunteers share in their own words why they choose to spend time working with Kloz 4 Kidz.</h4>

<!-- main page content when How It Works navigation is selected -->
<div id="content-how-it-works" style="display:none;">
	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>
		We offer free clothing on a seasonal basis to <b>school-aged children</b> residing in Snohomish County.
		Size availability varies depending upon donations, but in general we stock sizes from 4T up to teen/adult XXL.
	</p>
	<p>
		A child may receive clothing from us every 4 months (maximum 3 times per year). At each visit, the child will receive
		a set of gently used, school-appropriate clothing, consisting of:
		<ul>
			<li>3 shirts</li>
			<li>2 sweatshirts</li>
			<li>1-2 pairs of sweatpants and/or leggings (girls only)</li>
			<li>3 pairs of underwear (new)</li>
			<li>3 pairs of socks (new)</li>
			<li>1 pair of shoes</li>
			<!-- <li>1 coat (available November - March)</li> -->
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		As a temporary health and safety measure during the current pandemic, we are not allowing shoppers
		inside our portable.  <b>Most clothing selections will be made by our volunteers</b> using parent guidance 
		provided on the appointment form.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this time, since we are unable to provide fitting rooms, <b>we are temporarily unable to provide jeans</b>. 
		We ask parents to have their children try on shoes outside the portable.
		Jeans will return to availability when we are able to safely open our building to shoppers.
	</p>
	<p>
		To receive clothing for your child, please make an appointment using our online tool.
		As a part of the appointment process, you will be be asked questions about your child's age and clothing
		sizes and preferences.
		Get more information or begin your appointment process <a href="?appointments">here</a>.
