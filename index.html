	<h2>Appointments</h2>
	<p>
		If you are in need of free clothing for your school-aged Snohomish County child or children,
		we are here to help. We are opened for clothing pick-ups through May, and are planning to re-open for indoor
		appointments after our summer shutdown, on August 6th, 2022.
	</p>
	<p>
		Directions for our current appointment process are below. <i>Before you begin, please have your child's clothing sizes
			available.</i>
		<ol id="appt-instructions">
			<li><b>Click the 'Book Now' button</b> below and select an appointment time.
				Please choose a time you <b>and your child</b> will be available to come to Marysville 
				to pick up and fit your child's clothing.
			</li>
			<li><b>Fill out the appointment form.</b> Be sure to provide us with information about
				each child you are making a request for.
				<b>Click Continue</b> at the bottom of the form to make your appointment request.
			</li>
			<li>
				You should receive an email right away indicating that you have submitted your request. Within a day or two
				<b>you should receive another email confirming your appointment</b>.
				If you are not able to make your appointment please use the link provided in your
				confirmation email to cancel or reschedule.
			</li>
			<li>
				On your appointment day, <b>bring your child</b> to the Kloz 4 Kidz portable 
				located behind Marysville United Methodist Church and a volunteer will direct you.
				<b>At this time, we are requiring masks be worn by all family members.</b> 
				Please plan to arrive on time for your appointment.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Your appointment should last approximately 45 minutes.</b> During that time, 
				families are assisted by volunteers in selecting clothes of their choosing. 
				They will have access to a fitting room, and we require that jeans and shoes be tried on
				to ensure fit.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Our clothing inventory varies</b>, but every attempt is made 
				for each child to leave the appointment with 3 shirts, 2 sweatshirts, 1 pair of sweatpants, 
				1 pair of leggings (girls only), 1-2 pairs of jeans*, 3 pairs of socks, 3 pairs of underwear, 
				and a pair of shoes**. Depending upon the season, they may also receive a coat or shorts. 
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		*Please note that the <b>jeans must be tried on</b>, and their availability is 
		therefore dependent upon our access to our inside space with its fitting rooms. If we have to close again
		for indoor appointments, we will also not be providing jeans.
	</p>
	<p>
		**Because they make up our single largest budget item, <b>we typically limit each child to two pairs of shoes per year</b>.  
		If your child has outgrown their previous shoes and they are not yet eligible for another pair, 
		please let your volunteer know, as we may be able to make an exception.

<div id="content-volunteering" style="display:none;">
	<h2>Volunteering</h2>
	<p>We always need volunteers! 
		We are an entirely volunteer-run organization; if you are considering coming to work with us, 
		we are grateful.  Without you we would not be able to continue serving Snohomish County families.
	</p>  
	<h3>Current highest volunteer needs: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li class="odd"><b>Our greatest ongoing need is for people to work directly with families.</b> 
			These volunteers sign up for one or more 3 hour shifts per month, during which they help with clothing sizing and selection,
			and keep records of client visits.  Training is provided, and a background check (provided by K4K) is required.
			Please note that <b>many of our dedicated, ongoing volunteers are in a high-risk age group for Covid-19,</b>
			and to protect their health, it is absolutely essential that we get more help in this area.
		</li>
		<li class="even">
			As we prepare to reopen our portable for in-person shopping, 
			we need volunteers to <b>sort donations and stock our shelves</b>.
			These volunteers check clothing for stains or tears, fold or hang them, and keep an eye on our inventory levels.
			A regular weekday morning commitment is preferred, but even a single session helps, 
			so this is a great way to pitch in if you don't have a lot of time to spare. 
		</li>
		<li class="odd">
			Because we launder all our clothing donations, 
			<b>we always need people to wash and dry loads of clothes at home.</b>
			This is a super simple, low-commitment way to help. Volunteers simply take a bag of clothes home,
			wash, dry, and fold it, and return it to us.
		</li>
		<li class="even">
			Do you have idea about another way you could help?  We want to hear your ideas!  
			Let us know what you're thinking!
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you'd like more information about volunteering, have questions, or want to sign up, please email us 
		at <span class="email"><b>questions@kloz4kidz.com</b></span> or <span class="email"><b>k4kvolunteering@gmail.com</b></span>.

<!-- main page content when How It Works navigation is selected -->
<div id="content-how-it-works" style="display:none;">
	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>
		We offer free clothing on a seasonal basis to <b>school-aged children</b> residing in Snohomish County.
		Size availability varies depending upon donations, but in general we stock sizes from 4T up to teen/adult XXL.
	</p>
	<p>
		A child may receive clothing from us a maximum of 3 times per year at 4 month intervals. At each visit, the child will receive
		a set of gently used, school-appropriate clothing.  This list is subject to change, as it is dependent on availability,
		but the clothing will generally consist of:
		<ul>
			<li>3 shirts</li>
			<li>2 sweatshirts</li>
			<li>1-2 pairs of pants</li>
			<li>3 pairs of underwear (new)</li>
			<li>3 pairs of socks (new)</li>
			<li>1 pair of shoes</li>
			<li>1 coat (October - March) <b>OR</b> 2-3 pairs shorts (April - September)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		We are happy to be planning for a re-opening of our building for in-person appointments beginning in 
		August, 2022. Part of our mission is to give our families the school clothes shopping experience --  we have
		missed that and are looking forward to enjoying those in-person interactions again!  For the health and
		safety of you and our volunteers, please note that 
		<b>you and your children will be expected to wear a mask when in our space.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		A return to indoor appointments will also give us access to our fitting rooms, so we can go back to providing
		jeans (1-2 pairs per visit).  
	</p>
	<p>
		To receive clothing for your child, please make an appointment using our online tool.
		As a part of the appointment process, you will be be asked questions about your child's age and clothing
		sizes and preferences.  Please plan your appointment for a time when your child can be present, as we
		will have them try on items prior to leaving.
