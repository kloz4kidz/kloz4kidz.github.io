	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>
		We offer free clothing on a seasonal basis to <b>school-aged children</b> residing in Snohomish County.
		Size availability varies depending upon donations, but in general we stock sizes from 3T up to adult XXL (for teens).  
	</p>
	<p>
		Each child may receive a set of gently used clothing up to three times per year.  At this time, the set consists of:
		<ul>
			<li>3 shirts</li>
			<li>2 sweatshirts</li>
			<li>1 coat</li>
			<li>1-2 pairs of sweatpants (boys) or leggings (girls)</li>
			<li>3 pairs of underwear (new)</li>
			<li>3 pairs of socks (new)</li>
		As a temporary health and safety measure during the current pandemic, 
		<b>clothing selections will be made by our volunteers</b> using parent guidance provided on the appointment form.
		Parents will pick up pre-chosen clothing from our location <b>by appointment</b> only.
	</p>
	<p>
		To receive clothing for your child, please make an appointment using our online tool.  
		As a part of the appointment process, you will be be asked questions about your child's age and clothing sizes and preferences.
		Get more information or begin your appointment process <a href="#">here</a>.
